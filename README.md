# TMDB Client

**Watch in action**: https://lmakshow.github.io/tmdb-client/06-redux/

Looking for a fresh movie to watch? The web app would give you just that: the selection of popular movies or TV shows updating daily, and you can search the database if you want something specific. A click â€” and you'll have all the relevant info, from posters to trailers.

It was a playground for everything React.js: React hooks, React forms, React Router, Redux, RTKQ and more. There are different ways to code an app in the different branches of the repository.
